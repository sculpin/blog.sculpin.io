It's been a long time coming, but thanks to the intrepid efforts of
several contributors, Sculpin 3 is finally here.

This new release brings the project a bit more in line with modern PHP
features and introduces some new commands and parameters.

Shout out to the following folks for all of their contributions - thanks
for your help!

New in Sculpin 3:

* Supports PHP 7.2 and higher!
* Initialize a bare-bones set of `source/` files using the new `init`
  command
* The `generate` command now supports `--source-dir` and `--output-dir`
  parameters
* Create custom content types with the new `content:create` command
  * Generates a very basic skeleton of templates
  * Supports defining custom taxonomies (such as `tags` or `categories`
    or any other categorizations you need)

However, there are some changes that affect backwards compatibility.

* PHP 7.2 is the minimum PHP version that Sculpin 3 will run on
  * Some new return typehints may require custom bundles to have
    their method signatures updated.
  * A number of core classes are now `final` and some methods have been
    moved to `protected` and `private` to help reduce the code's
    complexity.
* Changes to the `symfony/yaml` component mean that certain YAML front
  matter values will need to be enclosed in quotes, particularly if they
  contain colons.
    * Sculpin should be quite verbose when this happens.
* Changes to pagination mean that certain URLs, such as
  "/blog/page/2.html", will change to a folder (e.g., "/blog/page/2/").
  * A gist can be found here with a concept for providing HTML-based
    redirects for legacy pagination files: [https://gist.github.com/beryllium/a1b0be7b603486f5e39f869db8ff3484](https://gist.github.com/beryllium/a1b0be7b603486f5e39f869db8ff3484)
* Bundles that write to the `sculpin.output_dir` parameter should be
  updated to use the `sculpin.writer` service instead, in order to
  respect the `--output-dir` parameter.

Also, the Sculpin Blog Skeleton has begun being modernized, and the
first stage of this involves setting things up with Yarn and Encore and
Webpack instead of the previous solution for assets.
